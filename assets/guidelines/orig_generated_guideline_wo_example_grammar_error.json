        "guideline": "### Grammar Characteristic: \"Can use 'and' to join a limited range of common adjectives\"\nThis feature involves using the conjunction \"and\" to link two adjectives that describe the same noun. Typically, these adjectives are common and familiar, often expressing similar or complementary qualities such as size, color, or emotion. The adjectives are generally of equal syntactic weight and are used to provide a single, unified description of the noun.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create an errorful sentence by misusing \"and\" with adjectives, we can break the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence include two adjectives that modify the same noun?**\n\n2. **Are the adjectives meant to express similar or complementary qualities?**\n\n3. **Is the conjunction \"and\" used between these two adjectives?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove \"and\" and replace it with a comma**, or leave the adjectives unconnected. This common error involves listing adjectives without proper conjunction.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"The house was old and charming.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence include two adjectives that modify the same noun? **Yes**\n- Are the adjectives meant to express similar or complementary qualities? **Yes** (old and charming)\n- Is the conjunction \"and\" used between these two adjectives? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove \"and\" and replace it with a comma, or leave unconnected: \"The house was old, charming.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"The house was old, charming.\"\n\nBy applying these steps, one can create sentences reflecting the error of improperly joining adjectives, providing learners with material for correction exercises."

The key is placing adjectives directly before the noun they describe, forming an attributive noun phrase like \"a beautiful garden\" or \"a noisy crowd.\"\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect improper usage of adjectives attributively before a noun, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a noun that is modified by one or more adjectives?**\n\n2. **Are the adjectives placed directly before the noun in the sentence?**\n\n3. **Are the adjectives attributively used rather than predicatively?** (Attributively means before the noun, whereas predicatively means after the verb, like in \"the garden is beautiful.\")\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Relocate the adjectives from their attributive position** to a predicative position, typically after a verb, to disrupt the attributive use.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She wore a stunning red dress.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a noun that is modified by one or more adjectives? **Yes**\n- Are the adjectives placed directly before the noun in the sentence? **Yes** (stunning red)\n- Are the adjectives attributively used rather than predicatively? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Relocate the adjectives from their attributive position to a predicative position: \"She wore a dress that was stunning and red.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She wore a dress that was stunning and red.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicating grammatical errors related to the attributive use of adjectives before a noun."

For example, in \"She really enjoys music,\" \"really\" is placed between the subject \"She\" and the main verb \"enjoys.\"\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to incorrectly use \"really\" out of its usual mid-position, we can follow two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a subject and a main verb?**\n\n2. **Is \"really\" used between the subject and the main verb?**\n\n3. **Does \"really\" aim to modify the main verb in the sentence?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Move \"really\" to a position that disrupts the usual mid-position rule**, such as placing it either before the subject or after the main verb.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"He really likes the new movie.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a subject and a main verb? **Yes**\n- Is \"really\" used between the subject and the main verb? **Yes**\n- Does \"really\" aim to modify the main verb in the sentence? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Move \"really\" to a position that disrupts the usual mid-position rule: \"Really he likes the new movie\" or \"He likes really the new movie.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"He likes really the new movie.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error involving the mid-position of \"really.\""

        "guideline": "### Grammar Characteristic: \"Can use the negative interrogative form of an auxiliary verb to express surprise or enthusiasm\"\n\nThe negative interrogative form of an auxiliary verb is used to express surprise, enthusiasm, or disbelief. Typically, it involves inverting the auxiliary verb and subject and adding 'not' to indicate the negative form. For instance, \"Doesn't he know?\" or \"Haven't you heard?\" These forms convey an expectation that the listener is or should be aware of the information being questioned.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo replicate a sentence with an error related to the negative interrogative form of an auxiliary verb, the process involves two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain an auxiliary verb that can be used in a negative form (e.g., is, are, have, do)?**\n\n2. **Is the sentence structured as a question?**\n\n3. **Is the negative form intended to express surprise or enthusiasm?**\n\n4. **Is 'not' used with the auxiliary verb and is the word order inverted (Auxiliary + not + Subject)?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Reorder the sentence to remove inversion, making it a statement rather than a question.** This results in a loss of the interrogative form.\n\n2. **Omit 'not' to remove the negative aspect.** This transforms the sentence into a positive statement or question.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"Isn't she coming to the party?\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain an auxiliary verb that can be used in a negative form (e.g., is, are, have, do)? **Yes**\n- Is the sentence structured as a question? **Yes**\n- Is the negative form intended to express surprise or enthusiasm? **Yes**\n- Is 'not' used with the auxiliary verb and is the word order inverted (Auxiliary + not + Subject)? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n1. Reorder the sentence to remove inversion, making it a statement: \"She is coming to the party.\"\n2. Omit 'not' to remove the negative aspect: \"She is coming to the party.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She is coming to the party.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can create sentences that reflect grammatical errors in the use of the negative interrogative form."

When 'who' functions as the object in a non-defining relative clause, it does not perform the action of the verb but is affected by it. For example, in the sentence \"My teacher, who I admire greatly, is retiring,\" the clause \"who I admire greatly\" gives more information about \"my teacher,\" and 'who' refers to the object of the admiration.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect a misunderstanding or misuse of the use of a non-defining relative clause with 'who' as the object, we can break the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a clause that adds extra information about a noun and is set off by commas?**\n\n2. **Is 'who' used in this clause to refer to a person?**\n\n3. **Is 'who' functioning as the object of the verb within the relative clause?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the commas that set off the non-defining clause**, which can lead to confusion about whether the information is essential.\n\n2. **Change 'who' to an incorrect relative pronoun (e.g., 'that')**, which is often a common error made by learners.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"My friend, who I met in college, is visiting.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a clause that adds extra information about a noun and is set off by commas? **Yes**\n- Is 'who' used in this clause to refer to a person? **Yes**\n- Is 'who' functioning as the object of the verb within the relative clause? **Yes** ('who I met')\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the commas that set off the non-defining clause: \"My friend who I met in college is visiting.\"\n- Change 'who' to an incorrect relative pronoun: \"My friend that I met in college is visiting.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"My friend that I met in college is visiting.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively replicate the grammatical error in sentences involving non-defining relative clauses with 'who' as the object."

The verbs within these clauses are finite, meaning they are marked for tense, person, and number.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect an error in using finite subordinate clauses for conditionals, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a subordinate clause that begins with a conjunction introducing a condition (e.g., \"if,\" \"unless\")?**\n\n2. **Does the subordinate clause contain a finite verb?**\n\n3. **Is there a main clause that could logically follow from the condition stated in the subordinate clause?**\n\n4. **Are the subordinate and main clauses correctly ordered with appropriate punctuation (comma if the subordinate clause is first)?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the conjunction introducing the subordinate clause**, leaving the clauses as separate sentences or incorrectly connected.\n\n2. **Remove or change the verb form in the subordinate clause** to a non-finite form or an incorrect tense that doesn't agree with the condition.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"If it rains, we will cancel the picnic.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a subordinate clause that begins with a conjunction introducing a condition? **Yes** (\"If it rains\")\n- Does the subordinate clause contain a finite verb? **Yes** (\"rains\")\n- Is there a main clause that could logically follow from the condition stated in the subordinate clause? **Yes** (\"we will cancel the picnic\")\n- Are the subordinate and main clauses correctly ordered with appropriate punctuation? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the conjunction introducing the subordinate clause: \"It rains, we will cancel the picnic.\"\n  \n- Alternatively, remove or change the verb form in the subordinate clause: \"If raining, we will cancel the picnic.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"It rains, we will cancel the picnic.\" or \"If raining, we will cancel the picnic.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively replicate errors related to the use of finite subordinate clauses in conditional sentences."

These conjunctions are fundamental for creating compound sentences, which are crucial for expressing complex ideas and relationships within a single sentence structure.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo replicate an error in using single word conjunctions to combine clauses, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain at least two clauses?**\n\n2. **Is each clause a complete thought with a subject and a predicate?**\n\n3. **Is a single word conjunction ('and', 'but', 'or') used to connect these clauses?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the conjunction** and replace it with a comma, making the sentence a run-on without proper conjunction.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She wanted to go for a walk, but it started to rain.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain at least two clauses? **Yes**\n- Is each clause a complete thought with a subject and a predicate? **Yes** (She wanted to go for a walk / it started to rain)\n- Is a single word conjunction ('and', 'but', 'or') used to connect these clauses? **Yes** ('but')\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the conjunction and replace it with a comma: \"She wanted to go for a walk, it started to rain.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She wanted to go for a walk, it started to rain.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively replicate grammatical errors related to using conjunctions to combine clauses."

The typical structure includes a first clause that sets a context or expectation, followed by 'yet' (or 'and yet') to introduce a contrasting or surprising second clause.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect incorrect usage of '(and) yet,' we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain two clauses or phrases that are logically connected?**\n\n2. **Is there an element of contrast or an unexpected relationship between these two clauses or phrases?**\n\n3. **Is '(and) yet' used to connect these clauses or phrases?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace '(and) yet' with 'and'** to remove the element of contrast or surprise and create an error in expressing unexpected relationships.\n\n2. **Alternatively, remove '(and) yet' entirely** to leave the clauses or phrases disconnected, creating an incomplete contrast.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"He is very talented, and yet he remains humble.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain two clauses or phrases that are logically connected? **Yes**\n- Is there an element of contrast or an unexpected relationship between these two clauses or phrases? **Yes** (talented yet humble)\n- Is '(and) yet' used to connect these clauses or phrases? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace '(and) yet' with 'and': \"He is very talented, and he remains humble.\"\n  \n**Transformed Sentence:** \"He is very talented, and he remains humble.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

This usage often implies that the speaker or writer is drawing attention to something new or previously unmentioned, making the reader or listener feel as if they are experiencing the events firsthand.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo introduce errors into a sentence involving the use of 'this' with nouns and noun phrases to create immediacy, we can divide the process into Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain 'this' used with a noun or noun phrase?**\n\n2. **Is 'this' being used to introduce or emphasize a noun or noun phrase in the narrative context?**\n\n3. **Does the sentence aim to create a sense of immediacy or direct engagement with the noun or noun phrase?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the linguistic feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace 'this' with 'the'** to reduce the immediacy or direct engagement with the noun or noun phrase.\n\n2. **Alternatively, remove 'this' altogether,** potentially creating ambiguity or less clarity in the narrative.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"This sudden noise startled everyone in the room.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain 'this' used with a noun or noun phrase? **Yes**\n- Is 'this' being used to introduce or emphasize a noun or noun phrase in the narrative context? **Yes** (sudden noise)\n- Does the sentence aim to create a sense of immediacy or direct engagement with the noun or noun phrase? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace 'this' with 'the': \"The sudden noise startled everyone in the room.\"\n- Alternatively, remove 'this': \"Sudden noise startled everyone in the room.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentences:**\n1. \"The sudden noise startled everyone in the room.\"\n2. \"Sudden noise startled everyone in the room.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

While adding 's in such cases is non-standard, understanding the typical use of 's is crucial.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to incorrectly apply ''s after a noun phrase with \"of\" to indicate possession, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a possessive relationship indicated by a noun phrase with \"of\"?**\n\n2. **Is the possessive relationship between the noun phrase and another noun?**\n\n3. **Is there currently no 's used to indicate possession in the sentence?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the linguistic feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Add 's** after the noun phrase that contains \"of\" to incorrectly indicate possession.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"The color of the car is vibrant.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a possessive relationship indicated by a noun phrase with \"of\"? **Yes** (\"the color of the car\")\n- Is the possessive relationship between the noun phrase and another noun? **Yes** (\"color\" and \"car\")\n- Is there currently no 's used to indicate possession in the sentence? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Add 's after the noun phrase that contains \"of\": \"The color of the car's is vibrant.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"The color of the car's is vibrant.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively replicate the grammatical error of incorrectly using ''s after a noun phrase with \"of\" to indicate possession."

However, \"shall\" can convey a sense of commitment and deliberate planning regarding future actions.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect the misuse of 'shall' for talking about long-term intentions, we break the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Is the sentence expressing a future action or intention?**\n\n2. **Is the subject of the sentence 'I' or 'we'?**\n\n3. **Is \"shall\" used to express this future intention or action?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace \"shall\" with \"will,\"** which is more commonly used in modern English for future intentions, to create a common grammatical error.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"We shall visit the new museum next year.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Is the sentence expressing a future action or intention? **Yes**\n- Is the subject of the sentence 'I' or 'we'? **Yes** (we)\n- Is \"shall\" used to express this future intention or action? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace \"shall\" with \"will\": \"We will visit the new museum next year.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"We will visit the new museum next year.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

Questions in English can be broadly categorized into several types, including yes/no questions, wh-questions, tag questions, and alternative questions. Each type follows specific syntactical rules. For example, yes/no questions typically involve subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., \"Are you happy?\"). Wh-questions involve wh-words such as who, what, where, when, why, and how, often followed by inversion (e.g., \"What are you doing?\"). Understanding these rules is essential for identifying whether a sentence is correctly formed as a question.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo intentionally create a grammatical error in a sentence using the question form, we can break the process into two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence include an auxiliary verb or a wh-word that indicates it is intended to be a question?**\n\n2. **Is there an inversion of the subject and the auxiliary verb (if applicable)?**\n\n3. **Is the sentence punctuated with a question mark at the end?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the subject-auxiliary inversion** to make it incorrect for yes/no questions or wh-questions (e.g., \"You are happy?\" instead of \"Are you happy?\").\n\n2. **Change the punctuation** from a question mark to a period, removing the indication that it is a question.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"Are you coming to the party?\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence include an auxiliary verb or a wh-word that indicates it is intended to be a question? **Yes** (auxiliary verb \"Are\")\n- Is there an inversion of the subject and the auxiliary verb (if applicable)? **Yes** (\"Are\" before \"you\")\n- Is the sentence punctuated with a question mark at the end? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the subject-auxiliary inversion: \"You are coming to the party?\"\n- Change the punctuation from a question mark to a period: \"You are coming to the party.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"You are coming to the party.\"\n\nBy following these steps, one can replicate a common error in forming questions, making it a useful exercise in understanding and correcting question forms."

The use of the present simple in these cases implies a sense of certainty or scheduled future action. \n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create an errorful sentence that misuses the present simple with 'when' to refer to the future, we can break the process into two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence include a time clause introduced by 'when'?**\n\n2. **Is the time clause used to refer to a future event?**\n\n3. **Is the present simple tense appropriately used in the time clause?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace the present simple tense with the future simple tense ('will' + base verb) within the 'when' clause** to replicate a common learner error.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"When the train arrives, we will leave.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence include a time clause introduced by 'when'? **Yes**\n- Is the time clause used to refer to a future event? **Yes**\n- Is the present simple tense appropriately used in the time clause? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace the present simple tense with the future simple tense: \"When the train will arrive, we will leave.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"When the train will arrive, we will leave.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively replicate a common grammatical error involving the misuse of the present simple in future time clauses."

The structure usually involves \"can't\" followed by an infinitive verb, and it targets specific actions or behaviors.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to incorrectly use negative forms of \"can\" to make reproaches or appeals, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence express a reproach or appeal by highlighting an inability or failure to perform an action?**\n\n2. **Is the negative form of \"can\" (cannot, can't) used in the sentence?**\n\n3. **Is the intended meaning of reproach or appeal clear and unambiguous?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the negative form of \"can\"** and replace it with the affirmative form \"can,\" altering the sentence to lose the reproach or appeal meaning.\n\n2. **Modify the sentence to create ambiguity** or an incorrect expression, such as adding unnecessary auxiliary verbs or other modal verbs.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"You can't just ignore your responsibilities like that.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence express a reproach or appeal by highlighting an inability or failure to perform an action? **Yes**\n- Is the negative form of \"can\" (cannot, can't) used in the sentence? **Yes**\n- Is the intended meaning of reproach or appeal clear and unambiguous? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace the negative form of \"can\" with the affirmative form: \"You can just ignore your responsibilities like that.\"\n- Modify the sentence to create ambiguity or incorrect expression: \"You can just to ignore your responsibilities like that?\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"You can just to ignore your responsibilities like that?\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

        "guideline": "### Grammar Characteristic: \"Can use 'might' as the past form of 'may' in indirect reports\"\n\nIn English grammar, \"might\" is often used as the past form of \"may\" in indirect speech. This shift in tense is part of the sequence of tenses rule, where the verb in the reported clause typically matches the past tense of the reporting verb. For instance, a direct statement such as \"She may arrive late\" becomes \"He said she might arrive late\" in indirect speech. This transformation is an essential part of conveying speech or thoughts indirectly, reflecting a shift from present to past modal verbs.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to misuse 'might' as the past form of 'may' in indirect reports, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Is there a sentence with a reporting verb indicating indirect speech (e.g., said, thought, believed)?**\n\n2. **Does the original direct speech contain the modal verb 'may'?**\n\n3. **Is the context of the sentence such that using the past form 'might' would be appropriate in indirect speech?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Use 'may' instead of 'might'** in the indirect report, disregarding the typical sequence of tenses.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She said that he might be at the party.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Is there a sentence with a reporting verb indicating indirect speech (e.g., said, thought, believed)? **Yes** (\"She said\")\n- Does the original direct speech contain the modal verb 'may'? **Yes** (implied from the original direct speech context)\n- Is the context of the sentence such that using the past form 'might' would be appropriate in indirect speech? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Use 'may' instead of 'might': \"She said that he may be at the party.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She said that he may be at the party.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively create a sentence with the intended grammatical error regarding the use of 'might' as the past form of 'may' in indirect reports."

This phrase is commonly interchanged with \"may as well,\" although \"might as well\" is more frequently used in informal contexts.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect the misuse of 'might as well' when suggesting a course of action, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence propose a course of action or suggestion?**\n\n2. **Is the proposed action described as logical or the easiest given the circumstances?**\n\n3. **Is there an implication that other alternatives are not better?**\n\n4. **Is \"might as well\" or \"may as well\" used in the sentence?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the linguistic feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Substitute \"might as well\" with \"may\"** to create a sentence where the suggestion becomes less about resignation and more about simply indicating permission or possibility, losing the sense of it being the only logical option.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"We might as well go home since the party is almost over.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence propose a course of action or suggestion? **Yes** \n- Is the proposed action described as logical or the easiest given the circumstances? **Yes** \n- Is there an implication that other alternatives are not better? **Yes**\n- Is \"might as well\" or \"may as well\" used in the sentence? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Substitute \"might as well\" with \"may\": \"We may go home since the party is almost over.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"We may go home since the party is almost over.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error concerning the use of \"might as well.\""

This structure is commonly used to reflect on past decisions with a sense of wishing they had been different.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to introduce an error in using 'should have' + '-ed', we can break the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence express a regret or an undesirable situation related to the past?**\n\n2. **Is 'should have' used in the sentence?**\n\n3. **Is the past participle of the verb correctly used following 'should have'?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace 'should have' with a different modal verb** (e.g., 'can' or 'will') that does not convey past regret.\n\n2. **Use the base form of the verb instead of the past participle** after 'should have' (e.g., use 'do' instead of 'done').\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She should have apologized for her mistake.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence express a regret or an undesirable situation related to the past? **Yes**\n- Is 'should have' used in the sentence? **Yes**\n- Is the past participle of the verb correctly used following 'should have'? **Yes** (apologized)\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace 'should have' with 'can': \"She can have apologized for her mistake.\"\n- Use the base form of the verb instead of the past participle: \"She should have apologize for her mistake.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentences:**\n- \"She can have apologized for her mistake.\"\n- \"She should have apologize for her mistake.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error of misusing 'should have' + '-ed'."

The question tag generally consists of the auxiliary verb in its negative or positive form and the subject pronoun.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create a sentence with an error in using 'will' to make predictions with question tags, we can divide the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a prediction about the future using 'will'?**\n\n2. **Is there a question tag at the end of the sentence?**\n\n3. **Does the question tag match the subject and auxiliary verb of the main clause?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Change the auxiliary verb in the question tag to another modal or auxiliary verb** that does not match the main clause.\n\n2. **Alter the subject in the question tag** so it does not correspond with the main clause's subject.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She will arrive on time, won't she?\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a prediction about the future using 'will'? **Yes**\n- Is there a question tag at the end of the sentence? **Yes**\n- Does the question tag match the subject and auxiliary verb of the main clause? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Change the auxiliary verb in the question tag to another modal or auxiliary verb: \"She will arrive on time, doesn't she?\"\n- Alter the subject in the question tag: \"She will arrive on time, doesn't he?\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She will arrive on time, doesn't he?\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively create sentences that replicate errors in using 'will' to make predictions with question tags."

This feature demonstrates a speaker's ability to express non-real or desired scenarios.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect the use of 'would' to express wishes and preferences, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain 'would' followed by a verb that indicates a wish or preference?**\n\n2. **Is the verb in its base form following 'would'?**\n\n3. **Is the structure expressing a hypothetical or non-real situation concerning desires or choices?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove 'would'** from the construction, making the verb appear as a simple present or past tense, potentially creating confusion about the hypothetical nature of the wish or preference.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"I would like to travel to Japan.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain 'would' followed by a verb that indicates a wish or preference? **Yes**\n- Is the verb in its base form following 'would'? **Yes** (like)\n- Is the structure expressing a hypothetical or non-real situation concerning desires or choices? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove 'would': \"I like to travel to Japan.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"I like to travel to Japan.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

For example, \"He asked her to help, but she wouldn't.\"\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect the incorrect usage of the negative forms of \"would\" for past willingness, we can break the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence describe a past event or situation?**\n\n2. **Is there an expression of unwillingness or refusal within this context?**\n\n3. **Is 'wouldn't' used correctly to indicate this past unwillingness?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace 'wouldn't' with 'didn't'** to incorrectly express refusal in the past, which confuses the intended meaning regarding willingness.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She tried to convince him, but he wouldn't change his mind.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence describe a past event or situation? **Yes**\n- Is there an expression of unwillingness or refusal within this context? **Yes** (he wouldn't change his mind)\n- Is 'wouldn't' used correctly to indicate this past unwillingness? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace 'wouldn't' with 'didn't': \"She tried to convince him, but he didn't change his mind.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She tried to convince him, but he didn't change his mind.\"\n\nBy following these steps, a grammatically correct sentence can be transformed to exhibit an error in using the negative form of \"would\" to express past unwillingness."

This reflects an understanding of how determiners specify and quantify nouns to form grammatically correct noun phrases.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create an errorful sentence that demonstrates a misunderstanding of forming simple noun phrases using a limited range of determiners with singular and plural nouns, we can break the process down into two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a noun phrase with a determiner and a noun?**\n\n2. **Is the determiner appropriate for the noun in terms of number (singular/plural)?**\n\n3. **Does the noun phrase function as a subject, object, or complement in the sentence?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Choose an inappropriate determiner for the noun in terms of number.** For example, pair a singular noun with a determiner that typically quantifies plural nouns, or vice versa.\n\n2. **Remove or replace the determiner incorrectly.** For instance, use \"a\" with plural nouns or omit determiners that should be present for definite references.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"The cats are playing in the yard.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a noun phrase with a determiner and a noun? **Yes** (\"The cats\")\n- Is the determiner appropriate for the noun in terms of number (singular/plural)? **Yes** (\"The\" with \"cats\")\n- Does the noun phrase function as a subject, object, or complement in the sentence? **Yes** (subject)\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Choose an inappropriate determiner for the noun in terms of number: \"A cats are playing in the yard.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"A cats are playing in the yard.\"\n\nBy following these steps, one can replicate errors related to forming simple noun phrases with determiners and nouns, aiding in the development of grammatical correction skills."

For example, in the phrase \"extremely bright star,\" \"extremely\" is the adverb modifying the adjective \"bright,\" which describes the noun \"star.\"\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create an errorful sentence that incorrectly employs or omits the adverb + adjective + noun structure, we can break the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence include an adverb directly modifying an adjective?**\n\n2. **Does the adjective modified by the adverb directly describe a noun?**\n\n3. **Does the sentence structure follow the pattern of adverb + adjective + noun?**\n\nIf the answers to all the questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the adverb**, leaving the adjective to independently modify the noun, thus simplifying the phrase.\n\n2. Alternatively, **misplace the adverb** so it modifies either the wrong adjective or a verb instead of the intended adjective.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"The incredibly fast train zoomed past.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence include an adverb directly modifying an adjective? **Yes** (\"incredibly\" modifies \"fast\")\n- Does the adjective modified by the adverb directly describe a noun? **Yes** (\"fast\" describes \"train\")\n- Does the sentence structure follow the pattern of adverb + adjective + noun? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n1. Remove the adverb: \"The fast train zoomed past.\"\n2. Misplace the adverb: \"The fast train incredibly zoomed past.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentences:**\n1. \"The fast train zoomed past.\"\n2. \"The fast train incredibly zoomed past.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error in forming complex noun phrases with adverb + adjective + noun."

Common examples include time expressions like \"every morning,\" \"last year,\" or \"next month.\" When functioning correctly, these noun phrases often follow prepositions or directly modify the verb phrase to denote time accurately.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create an errorful sentence using nouns and noun phrases as adjuncts in time expressions, we will break the process into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a noun or noun phrase functioning as a time expression?**\n\n2. **Is the noun or noun phrase intended to specify when an action occurs, its frequency, or duration?**\n\n3. **Is the noun or noun phrase grammatically positioned as an adjunct to the verb or main clause?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Omit the preposition or article** that typically precedes the noun or noun phrase when necessary, leading to a grammatically incomplete time expression.\n\n2. **Change the position** of the noun or noun phrase, placing it in an awkward or incorrect part of the sentence.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"We will meet next week.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a noun or noun phrase functioning as a time expression? **Yes** (next week)\n- Is the noun or noun phrase intended to specify when an action occurs, its frequency, or duration? **Yes**\n- Is the noun or noun phrase grammatically positioned as an adjunct to the verb or main clause? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Omit the preposition or article: \"We will meet week.\"\n- Change the position: \"Next we will meet week.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"We will meet week.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate grammatical errors involving the use of nouns and noun phrases as adjuncts in time expressions."

For example, \"The cake was eaten by the children\" emphasizes the cake rather than the children.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect an error in the use of the passive with 'by' to give focus, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Is the sentence in passive voice?**\n\n2. **Does the sentence include a 'by' phrase to indicate the agent performing the action?**\n\n3. **Is the focus intended to be on the action or the recipient of the action rather than the doer?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the 'by' phrase** entirely to eliminate the clarity of the agent performing the action, even if it is essential for understanding.\n\n2. **(Optional) Misplace or incorrectly modify the verb form** to disrupt the passive structure.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"The book was read by the teacher to the class.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Is the sentence in passive voice? **Yes**\n- Does the sentence include a 'by' phrase to indicate the agent performing the action? **Yes** (by the teacher)\n- Is the focus intended to be on the action or the recipient of the action rather than the doer? **Yes** (focus on \"The book\")\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the 'by' phrase entirely: \"The book was read to the class.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"The book was read to the class.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively replicate the grammatical error related to the passive voice and its focus."

Identify the main verb and convert it to its past participle form: \"finish\" becomes \"finished.\"\n2. Insert \"not been\" between \"has/have\" and the past participle: \"has not been finished.\"\n3. Ensure the subject of the sentence is receiving the action: \"The report has not been finished.\"\n4. Convert the direct speech to indirect speech: \"John said that the report has not been finished.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"John said that the report has not been finished.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical feature of the present perfect passive negative form in reported speech."

Ensure the structure follows the preposition directly: \"Before having been reviewed, they were signed off.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"Before having been reviewed, they were signed off.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical feature or introduce errors for educational purposes."

It implies a level of flexibility or hypothetical consideration that is often more socially acceptable in formal communication.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create a sentence that incorrectly uses the past simple after 'if' without adhering to the politeness structure, you can follow these steps in two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence involve a request or suggestion?**\n\n2. **Is the past simple used after 'if' to introduce this request or suggestion?**\n\n3. **Is the sentence intended to be polite or formal?**\n\nIf the answers to these questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Change the past simple to present simple** after 'if' to make it sound more direct and less polite.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"If you needed more information, please let me know.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence involve a request or suggestion? **Yes**\n- Is the past simple used after 'if' to introduce this request or suggestion? **Yes** (needed)\n- Is the sentence intended to be polite or formal? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Change the past simple to present simple: \"If you need more information, please let me know.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"If you need more information, please let me know.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences, replicating the error by not utilizing the past simple to express politeness in conditional requests or suggestions."

This feature is essential for expressing denial, absence, or refusal.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect misuse or error in the negative form, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Is the sentence attempting to convey a negative meaning or denial?**\n\n2. **Does the sentence include an auxiliary or modal verb before the main verb?**\n\n3. **Is \"not\" or another negative element used appropriately after the auxiliary or modal verb, or with \"do/does/did\" in the absence of auxiliary verbs?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Omit the auxiliary or modal verb** necessary for creating the negative form, or place \"not\" incorrectly within the sentence.\n\n2. **Remove \"do/does/did\" support** when forming the negative with a main verb.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"I do not like spinach.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Is the sentence attempting to convey a negative meaning or denial? **Yes**\n- Does the sentence include an auxiliary or modal verb before the main verb? **Yes** (do)\n- Is \"not\" or another negative element used appropriately after the auxiliary or modal verb? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Omit the auxiliary verb or place \"not\" incorrectly: \"I not like spinach.\"\n  \n**Transformed Sentence:** \"I not like spinach.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate errors in the use of the negative form."

This is considered informal or colloquial in tone, but it's grammatically acceptable in English. An example would be \"the book that I was talking about,\" where \"about\" is the preposition stranded at the end.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create a sentence with an error involving a stranded preposition in a relative clause, we break the process into two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a noun modified by a relative clause?**\n\n2. **Is there a preposition within the relative clause?**\n\n3. **Is the preposition currently placed before its complement (i.e., not stranded)?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the linguistic feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Move the preposition to the end of the relative clause,** thereby stranding it from its complement.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"This is the book about which we talked.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a noun modified by a relative clause? **Yes** (the book)\n- Is there a preposition within the relative clause? **Yes** (about)\n- Is the preposition currently placed before its complement (i.e., not stranded)? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Move the preposition to the end of the relative clause: \"This is the book which we talked about.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"This is the book which we talked about.\"\n\nBy following these steps, one can effectively replicate sentences that end a relative clause with a stranded preposition."

Plural reflexive pronouns, such as \"ourselves,\" \"yourselves,\" and \"themselves,\" specifically apply when referring to multiple people or things performing an action on themselves. The correct usage requires that the pronoun agree in both number and person with the subject of the sentence. This construction emphasizes that the action is self-directed.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo replicate an errorful sentence regarding the use of plural reflexive pronouns, we can follow a structured approach divided into two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence include a plural subject performing an action?**\n\n2. **Does the sentence imply that the subject is also the object of the action?**\n\n3. **Is there a plural reflexive pronoun used to indicate that the subject is performing the action on itself?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Use a singular reflexive pronoun** instead of a plural reflexive pronoun to create a grammatical error in agreement.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"They taught themselves the new language.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence include a plural subject performing an action? **Yes** (They)\n- Does the sentence imply that the subject is also the object of the action? **Yes** (They taught themselves)\n- Is there a plural reflexive pronoun used to indicate that the subject is performing the action on itself? **Yes** (themselves)\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Use a singular reflexive pronoun: \"They taught himself the new language.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"They taught himself the new language.\"\n\nFollowing these steps helps replicate errors in the use of plural reflexive pronouns by disrupting the grammatical agreement required in such contexts."

In English, subject pronouns such as 'I', 'you', 'he', 'she', 'it', 'we', and 'they' are used to indicate who or what is performing the action of the verb. These pronouns must appear in the subject position (i.e., before the verb) to form a grammatically correct statement.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo replicate an error related to the use of pronouns in the subject position, follow these two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a pronoun acting as the subject?**\n\n2. **Is the pronoun one of the following: 'I', 'you', 'he', 'she', 'it', 'we', 'they'?**\n\n3. **Is the pronoun placed directly before the verb in the statement?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace the subject pronoun with an incorrect pronoun or noun** that does not fit the subject position in standard English syntax (e.g., using an object pronoun like 'me', 'him', 'her', 'us', or 'them').\n\n2. **Omit the subject pronoun entirely**, leaving the verb without a clear subject.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"He runs fast.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a pronoun acting as the subject? **Yes**\n- Is the pronoun one of the following: 'I', 'you', 'he', 'she', 'it', 'we', 'they'? **Yes** ('He')\n- Is the pronoun placed directly before the verb in the statement? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace the subject pronoun with an incorrect pronoun: \"Him runs fast.\"\n- Alternatively, omit the subject pronoun entirely: \"Runs fast.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentences:**\n1. \"Him runs fast.\"\n2. \"Runs fast.\"\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively create sentences with errors related to the use of pronouns in the subject position."

        "guideline": "### Grammar Characteristic: \"Can use 'this' as a pronoun to refer back to single things or groups of plural things which have already been mentioned\"\n\nIn English, the pronoun \"this\" is often used to refer back to something previously mentioned in the discourse. It serves as a demonstrative pronoun, pointing to either a singular noun (a single entity) or a group of plural nouns (multiple entities) that have already been introduced. This usage helps maintain cohesion and avoids repetition by not needing to rename the noun or nouns. \n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo create a sentence that fails to correctly use \"this\" as a pronoun referring back to previously mentioned items, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Has the noun or group of nouns been explicitly mentioned prior in the discourse?**\n\n2. **Is \"this\" used to refer back to that previously mentioned noun or group of nouns?**\n\n3. **Does \"this\" clearly indicate which specific noun or nouns it is referring back to?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace \"this\" with an incorrect pronoun** such as \"it\" for plural nouns or \"these\" for a singular noun to disrupt the reference.\n\n2. **Introduce a different demonstrative pronoun (e.g., \"that,\" \"those\")** that does not match the number (singular/plural) or distance (near/far) of the items being referred to.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"I found some old coins and stamps in the attic. This was quite a discovery.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Has the noun or group of nouns been explicitly mentioned prior in the discourse? **Yes** (coins and stamps)\n- Is \"this\" used to refer back to that previously mentioned noun or group of nouns? **Yes**\n- Does \"this\" clearly indicate which specific noun or nouns it is referring back to? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace \"this\" with an incorrect pronoun: \"I found some old coins and stamps in the attic. *It* was quite a discovery.\"\n- Alternatively, introduce a different demonstrative pronoun: \"I found some old coins and stamps in the attic. *Those* was quite a discovery.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"I found some old coins and stamps in the attic.

Correct usage requires ensuring that the pronoun agrees with the verb and fits logically within the sentence's structure.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo replicate an errorful sentence when using these pronouns as subject and object pronouns, follow the two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Is the pronoun 'each', 'either', 'enough', 'neither', or 'several' used in the sentence?**\n\n2. **Is the pronoun serving as the subject or object of the sentence?**\n\n3. **Does the pronoun logically fit as the subject or object, agreeing with the verb in number and meaning?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Misuse the pronoun in a way that disrupts agreement with the verb**, such as using a singular pronoun with a plural verb or vice versa.\n\n2. **Place the pronoun in a syntactically incorrect position**, leading to confusion about its role as subject or object.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"Each of the students has completed their assignment.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Is the pronoun 'each', 'either', 'enough', 'neither', or 'several' used in the sentence? **Yes** ('Each')\n- Is the pronoun serving as the subject or object of the sentence? **Yes** (Subject)\n- Does the pronoun logically fit as the subject or object, agreeing with the verb in number and meaning? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Misuse the pronoun with a plural verb: \"Each of the students have completed their assignment.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"Each of the students have completed their assignment.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate errors associated with using these pronouns as subjects or objects."

For example, in \"Isn't she coming?\", 'is' is the main verb, 'n't' indicates negation, and the sentence is structured as a question.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to incorrectly apply the structure of 'be' + 'n't' for negative 'yes/no' questions, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain the main verb 'be' (am, is, are, was, were)?**\n\n2. **Is the sentence structured as a question?**\n\n3. **Is there a negation using 'n't' attached to the main verb 'be'?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the inversion of the subject and the verb 'be',** placing the subject before the verb instead, and leaving the structure as a declarative sentence.\n\n2. **Omit 'n't' from the main verb 'be'** and place 'not' after the subject, thereby making the negation incorrect for a 'yes/no' question format.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"Isn't she coming?\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain the main verb 'be' (am, is, are, was, were)? **Yes**\n- Is the sentence structured as a question? **Yes**\n- Is there a negation using 'n't' attached to the main verb 'be'? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the inversion: \"She is.\"\n- Omit 'n't' and place 'not' after the subject: \"She is not coming?\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She is not coming?\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

The structure involves a phrasal verb, a particle that often dictates the action's nuance, and an object receiving the action.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a sentence to demonstrate an error in the use of phrasal verbs + particle + object, we can break the process into two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a phrasal verb consisting of a verb and a particle?**\n\n2. **Is the particle correctly used in conjunction with the verb to form a recognized phrasal verb?**\n\n3. **Does the phrasal verb have an object following it?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the linguistic feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Remove the particle** from the phrasal verb, leaving only the verb and the object. \n\n2. **Rearrange the sentence if necessary** to fit the new structure with just a verb and object.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She turned off the lights.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a phrasal verb consisting of a verb and a particle? **Yes** (\"turned off\")\n- Is the particle correctly used in conjunction with the verb to form a recognized phrasal verb? **Yes**\n- Does the phrasal verb have an object following it? **Yes** (\"the lights\")\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the particle: \"She turned the lights.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She turned the lights.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate errors in using phrasal verbs with particles and objects."

The adjective complement provides additional information about the subject, serving as a key element in a predicate adjective structure. These verbs do not express action but rather serve to link the subject with its description or state of being.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to incorrectly use linking verbs with adjective complements, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a linking verb?**\n\n2. **Is there an adjective following the linking verb?**\n\n3. **Does the adjective complement provide a description or quality of the subject?**\n\n4. **Is the adjective complement directly connected to the subject through the linking verb?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace the linking verb with an action verb** that does not appropriately connect the subject with its description, disrupting the intended meaning.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She seems happy.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a linking verb? **Yes** (\"seems\")\n- Is there an adjective following the linking verb? **Yes** (\"happy\")\n- Does the adjective complement provide a description or quality of the subject? **Yes**\n- Is the adjective complement directly connected to the subject through the linking verb? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Replace the linking verb with an action verb: \"She runs happy.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She runs happy.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error concerning linking verbs and adjective complements."

Common examples of linking verbs include \"am,\" \"is,\" \"are,\" \"was,\" \"were,\" \"seem,\" \"become,\" \"appear,\" \"feel,\" \"look,\" \"sound,\" \"taste,\" and \"smell.\" These verbs often pair with complements that provide more information about the subject.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a given sentence to reflect errors in the use of a wide range of linking verbs with complements, we can break the process down into two main phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a linking verb connecting the subject to a complement?**\n\n2. **Is the complement providing additional information about the subject (such as an adjective or noun phrase)?**\n\n3. **Is the linking verb correctly paired with an appropriate complement?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Replace the linking verb with an incorrect or less appropriate verb** that does not properly connect the subject to the complement, possibly using an action verb or a non-standard verb for the context.\n\n2. **Misuse the complement** so it does not logically or grammatically fit with the subject or verb.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"The soup tastes delicious.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a linking verb connecting the subject to a complement? **Yes** (tastes)\n- Is the complement providing additional information about the subject (such as an adjective or noun phrase)? **Yes** (delicious)\n- Is the linking verb correctly paired with an appropriate complement? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n1. Replace the linking verb with an incorrect or less appropriate verb: \"The soup eats delicious.\"\n2. Misuse the complement: \"The soup eats delicious quickly.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"The soup eats delicious quickly.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

Next, I mixed them together.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Is the sentence part of a sequence of events or instructions that needs to be organized clearly? **Yes**\n- Does the sentence contain a sequencing adverb indicating order (e.g., first, next, then, finally)? **Yes** (\"Firstly,\" \"Next\")\n- Is the sequencing adverb used correctly to indicate the logical order or flow of ideas? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Remove the sequencing adverb: \"I gathered all the ingredients. I mixed them together.\"\n- Reorder the events: \"I mixed them together. I gathered all the ingredients.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"I mixed them together.

This structure often appears in literary contexts, creating a stylistic emphasis by placing the verb first.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a sentence to replicate an error in this grammatical feature, follow these two phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain a direct speech quotation?**\n\n2. **Is there a reporting clause that includes a proper noun or noun phrase as the subject?**\n\n3. **Is the reporting clause positioned typically with the subject preceding the verb?**\n\nIf the answers to all relevant questions are \"Yes,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Maintain the typical order of subject and verb** in the reporting clause (i.e., keep the subject before the verb).\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"John said, 'I am hungry.'\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain a direct speech quotation? **Yes**\n- Is there a reporting clause that includes a proper noun or noun phrase as the subject? **Yes** (John)\n- Is the reporting clause positioned typically with the subject preceding the verb? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Maintain the typical order of subject and verb: \"John said, 'I am hungry.'\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"John said, 'I am hungry.'\"\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure a sentence maintains the usual subject-verb order in reporting clauses while handling direct speech, effectively replicating an errorful sentence related to this linguistic feature."

It is formed using the past tense of \"be\" (was/were) + the present participle (-ing form) of the main verb. To make it negative, \"not\" or \"n't\" is added after the auxiliary verb: \"was not/were not\" or \"wasn't/weren't\".\n\n- **Past Perfect**: This tense describes actions that were completed before a certain point in the past.

Errors occur when the affirmative form of the verb is used instead, which contradicts the intended negative meaning.\n\n### Steps to Transform a Sentence\n\nTo transform a sentence and reflect the incorrect usage of \"neither of\" or \"none of\" with the affirmative verb form, follow these phases: Identification and Actionable Changes.\n\n#### Phase 1: Identification\n\n1. **Does the sentence contain \"neither of\" or \"none of\" followed by a pronoun or noun phrase?**\n\n2. **Is the meaning intended to be negative (indicating absence or lack)?**\n\n3. **Is the verb used following \"neither of\" or \"none of\" currently in its negative form?**\n\nIf the answers to the first two questions are \"Yes\" and the third question is \"No,\" then the grammatical feature is applicable.\n\n#### Phase 2: Actionable Changes\n\n1. **Change the verb to its affirmative form,** removing any negative markers like \"not\" or \"n't\" to create a contrast between the negative quantifier and the affirmative verb.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"Neither of the options is available.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence contain \"neither of\" or \"none of\" followed by a pronoun or noun phrase? **Yes** (\"neither of the options\")\n- Is the meaning intended to be negative (indicating absence or lack)? **Yes**\n- Is the verb used following \"neither of\" or \"none of\" currently in its negative form? **Yes** (\"is\")\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Change the verb to its affirmative form, removing any negative markers: \"Neither of the options are available.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"Neither of the options are available.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."

This action introduces a grammatical error by incorrectly indicating certainty instead of possibility.\n\n### Example\n\n**Original Sentence:** \"She could have gone to the concert.\"\n\n**Identification:**\n- Does the sentence refer to a past event or situation? **Yes**\n- Is there an indication of an unrealized possibility or opportunity in the past? **Yes** (going to the concert)\n- Is there a need to express hypothetical scenarios using perfect aspect? **Yes**\n\n**Actionable Changes:**\n- Change \"could have\" to a simple past tense: \"She went to the concert.\"\n\n**Transformed Sentence:** \"She went to the concert.\"\n\nBy following these structured steps, one can effectively transform sentences to replicate the grammatical error."
